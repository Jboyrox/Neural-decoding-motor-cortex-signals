# Neural-decoding-motor-cortex-signals
Machine learning is a key tool for neuroscientists to understand how sensory and motor signals are encoded in the brain. In addition to improving our scientific understanding of neural phenomena, understanding neural encoding is critical for brain machine interfaces. I  use model selection for performing some simple analysis on real neural signals.
I also:
1)Represent neural time-series data in arrays
2)Load data from a pickle file
3)Describe and fit memoryless linear models
4)Describe and fit linear time-series models with delays
5)Fit linear models with multiple target outputs
6)Select the optimal delay via cross-validation
To get the results run the notebook neural.ipynb
